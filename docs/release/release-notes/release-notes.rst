Summary
=======
This document provides the release notes for IEC Blue Print in Akraino.
IEC (Integrated Edge Cloud) is a platform that will enable new functionalities
and business models on the network edge. The benefits of running applications on
the network edge are - Better latencies for end users - Less load on network
since more data can be processed locally - Fully utilize the computation power
of the edge devices.

to work with multiple edge use-cases.
