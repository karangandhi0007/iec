Akraino IEC Installation Instruction
************************************


Introduction
============

This document provides guidelines on how to install the Akraino IEC Release 1,
including required software and hardware configurations.

The audience of this document is assumed to have good knowledge of
networking and Unix/Linux administration.

Currently, the chosen operating system (OS) is Ubuntu 16.04 and/or 18.04.
The infrastructure orchestration of IEC is based on Kubernetes, which is a
production-grade container orchestration with a rich running eco-system.
The current container network interface (CNI) solution chosen for Kubernetes is
project Calico, which is a high performance, scalable, policy enabled and
widely used container networking solution with rather easy installation and
arm64 support.

How to use this document
========================

The following sections describe the prerequisites for planning an IEC
deployment. Once these are met, installation steps provided should be followed
in order to obtain an IEC compliant Kubernetes cluster.

Deployment Architecture
=======================

The reference cluster platform consists of 3 nodes, baremetal or virtual
machines:

- the first node will have the role of Kubernetes Master;
- all other nodes will have the role of Kubernetes Slave;
- Calico will be used as container network interface (CNI);

One additional management/orchestration node (which will be referred to as
``jumpserver`` or ``orchestration node``) is necessary for running the
installation steps.

If all nodes are virtual machines on the same machine which is also used as the
``jumpserver``, the deployment type will be referred to as ``virtual`` - useful
mostly for development and/or testing and not production grade.

.. NOTE::

    The default number of Kubernetes slaves is 2; although less or more slaves
    can be used as well.

.. WARNING::

    Currently, we assume all the cluster nodes have the same architecture
    (``aarch64`` or ``x86_64``).

All machines (including the ``jumpserver``) should be part of at least one
common network segment.

Pre-Installation Requirements
=============================

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

.. NOTE::

    Hardware requirements depend on the deployment type.
    If more cluster nodes are used, the requirements for a single node can
    be lowered, provided that the sum of available resources is enough.

    Depending on the intended usecase(s), more memory/storage might be
    required for running/storing the containers.

Installation High-Level Overview
================================

Bare Metal Deployment Guide
---------------------------

Install Bare Metal Jump Host
````````````````````````````

The jump host (``jumpserver``) operating system should be preprovisioned.
No special software requirements apply apart from package prerequisites:

- git
- sshpass

Creating a Node Inventory File
``````````````````````````````

N/A

Creating the Settings Files
```````````````````````````

Clone the IEC git repo and edit the configuration file by setting:

- user name for SSH-ing into cluster nodes (default: ``iec``);
- user password for SSH-ing into cluster nodes;
- Kubernetes master node IP address (should be reachable from ``jumpserver``
  and accept SSH connections);
- Kubernetes slave node(s) IP address(es) and passwords for SSH access;

.. code-block:: console

    jenkins@jumpserver:~$ git clone https://gerrit.akraino.org/r/iec.git
    jenkins@jumpserver:~$ cd iec/src/foundation/scripts
    jenkins@jumpserver:~/iec/src/foundation/scripts$ vim config.sh

Running
```````

Simply start the installation script in the same directory:

.. code-block:: console

    jenkins@jumpserver:~/iec/src/foundation/scripts$ ./startup.sh

Virtual Deployment Guide
------------------------

Standard Deployment Overview
````````````````````````````

From the installer script's perspective, virtual deployments are identical to
baremetal ones.
Preprovision some virtual machines on the ``jumpserver`` node as hypervisor,
using Ubuntu 16.04/18.04, then continue the installation similar to the
baremetal deployment process described above.

````````````````````````````````````````````

N/A

Install Jump Host
'''''''''''''''''

Similar to baremetal deployments. Additionally, one hypervisor solution should
be available for creating the cluster nodes virtual machines (e.g. KVM).

N/A

Running
```````

Similar to virtual deployments, edit the configuration file, then launch the
installation script:

.. code-block:: console

    jenkins@jumpserver:~$ git clone https://gerrit.akraino.org/r/iec.git
    jenkins@jumpserver:~$ cd iec/src/foundation/scripts
    jenkins@jumpserver:~/iec/src/foundation/scripts$ vim config.sh
    jenkins@jumpserver:~/iec/src/foundation/scripts$ ./startup.sh

Interacting with Containerized Overcloud
````````````````````````````````````````

N/A

Verifying the Setup
===================

IEC installation automatically performs one simple test of the Kubernetes
cluster installation by spawning an ``nginx`` container and fetching a sample
file via HTTP.

`Akraino Blueprint Validation`_ integration will later offer a complete e2e
(end to end) validation of the Kubernetes installation by running the complete
e2e test suite of `Sonobuoy`_ diagnostics suite.
Meanwhile, `Sonobuoy`_ can be used manually by following the instructions in
its README file.
