Introduction
============
The purpose of this Document is to enumerate the APIs which are exposed by
IEC Akraino Blue print project to the external projects Akraino/Non Akraino
for interaction/integration.

In Akraino Release 1 there aren't any APIs exposed by IEC project, but it is
expected to have APIs in future releases.
