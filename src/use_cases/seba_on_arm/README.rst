      Convention for heading levels in Integrated Edge Cloud documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

which would also be a sample use case of IEC. 

We would enable SEBA on arm with the native installation method for SEBA by great efforts.
